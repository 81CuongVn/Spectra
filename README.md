**Add Spectra to your server:**

Please see [Getting Started](https://github.com/jagrosh/Spectra/wiki/Getting-Started) for the link and instructions. Note that Spectra is designed to run on servers with at least 200 members. The actual requirement is not that high, but it is recommended.


**Read the Wiki:**

The code here is strictly an example. It may not be the live code at any given point. Running this code on your own is not supported; I will not be providing the resources necessary to self-host.
